# geocheckins

`geocheckins` is a simple web application that generates useful geographical information about customers, venues and their check-ins on Foursquare social network. The application was developed as an assignment for the UbiComp course at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) by doctoral student Habib Asseiss Neto.

The application allows you to query any location using Google Maps API. Then a map is displayed along with information about Foursquare check-ins made in that area that includes number of venues, number of customers, number of check-ins and the average rating given to those check-ins. The offered information can be useful and interesting, e.g. there can be calculated the average venue rating in different cities in different countries. You can see for instance that the average rating using the address `R. Santa Teresa, 64 - Centro, SÃ£o Paulo - SP` (within `50` km) is 2.49 (out of 5.00) and on the other hand at `4888 Gore Rd, Highgate Center, VT 05459, USA` (within `50` km) is 4.10 (out of 5.00). This information allows a deeper study on the average rating of the different cities and countries and the customer satisfaction in different locations.

## Demo

There is a demo instance of the application available at:
http://geocheckins.hneto.com

## Dataset

The dataset used in this application contains 2153471 users, 1143092 venues, 1021970 check-ins, 27098490 social connections, and 2809581 ratings that users assigned to venues; all extracted from the Foursquare application through the public API.

The dataset was obtained from:

## Geolocation calculations

Most records from the dataset have `latitude` and `longitude` attributes corresponding to a geolocation when certain events occur.

The application uses the coordinates to calculate the venues and customers found within a certain range in kilometers. The Haversine formula is used for computing great-circle distances between two pairs of coordinates on a sphere.

The following SQL query finds points within a range of 25 km to the 37,-122 coordinate. To search in miles instead of kilometers, replace 6371 with 3959.

```
SELECT id,
( 6371 * acos( cos( radians(37) ) * cos( radians( lat ) ) * cos( radians( lng ) - radians(-122) ) + sin( radians(37) ) * sin( radians( lat ) ) ) ) AS distance
FROM markers
HAVING distance < 25
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 0 , 20
```

## Google Maps API

Google Maps API is used to display the map of the requested address.

Google Maps API documentation is found at:

## csv-converter

It is provided a script that converts the format of existing data files to a regular csv format.

The script expects the input file and the output file as parameters:

`python csv-converter.py in.dat out.csv`

The obtained format is shown below.
```
id    |       latitude        |       longitude       
---------+-----------------------+-----------------------
101759 |            45.5405832 |           -73.5965186
101762 |            45.5154736 |           -73.5643264
449060 |             38.962166 |            -94.604425
...
```

The `csv-converter` script will translate it to a regular csv file, as shown below.

```
id,latitude,longitude
101759,45.5405832,-73.5965186
101762,45.5154736,-73.5643264
449060,38.962166,-94.604425
...
```

Using the converted csv file it is possible to import data to any database table.

## Importing large datasets into server

Because the csv files are usually very large, the recommended way of importing it to a database server is by command line on the server itself.

Use `mysql -u user -p` command to enter the database console, then use the following command to import the csv file to the specified table:

```
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'venues.csv'
INTO TABLE venues
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES
(@col1,@col2,@col3) set id=@col1,latitude=@col2,longitude=@col3;
```

## Limitations

The currently simple implementation has a memory limitation on the number of venues returned on a given location. For instance, you can't retrieve information using the address `New York, NY` and a range of a few kilometers. So, try to be more specific about the address and lower the range.
